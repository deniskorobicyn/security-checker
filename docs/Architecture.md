### Security checker

#### Ideal
- can check any type of language
- easily extendable

#### MVP 0
- check python code
- react to webhook
- to be able to work on this repo

##### problems accured
 - safety is paid tool eventually
 - all tools are based on top of NVD or smth like that

#### additional ideas
- use of https://osv.dev/list
- direct usage of databases for vulnerailities
- main feature of the project is dashboards and overview of all vulnerabilities
